I’m thrilled to share that I’ve designed and developed the official website for Hoshmand Energy Bahrevaran Paydar (HEBP) — a company specialized in renewable energy, industrial optimization, and energy consulting.

This project was far more than a simple website build; it was a complete hands-on journey in:
<br>🔹 Fully bilingual implementation (English / Persian) with dynamic language switching
<br>🔹 Mobile responsiveness and performance optimization
<br>🔹 SEO-friendly structure for better visibility
<br>🔹 Dynamic content integration for projects and articles

Through this experience, I learned how every small detail — from spacing to typography to load speed — can shape the way users interact with a brand online.

Big thanks to the HEBP team for their trust and collaboration 🙏
And here’s to many more meaningful projects ahead!
